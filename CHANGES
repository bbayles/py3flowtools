Version 0.2 

    - The flow attributes "first" and "last" now return standard
    Unix timestamps (i.e. seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00). To get
    the raw values as found in the NetFlow data, you can use
    "first_raw" and "last_raw".
      
    - For each flow attribute "x" returning an IP address, a "x_raw"
    variant has been added, that returns the address as a long
    integer rather than as a string.
      
    - Values defined as uint32 in flow records are converted to long
    ints (rather than ints).
