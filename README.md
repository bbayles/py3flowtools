This repository holds Python tools for interacting with NetFlow data. They are
lightweight wrappers on top of the [flow-tools](https://code.google.com/p/flow-tools/)
and [flowd](https://code.google.com/p/flowd/) binaries.

I started with the idea of updating the [pyflowtools](http://code.google.com/p/pyflowtools/)
to support Python 3. However, I decided I wanted to use a more permissive
license and develop more rapidly.
